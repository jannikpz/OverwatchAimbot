# OverwatchAimbot with yolo MLM (the aimbot sucks code/performancewise because i have no idea how to work with ingamesens)

If u want to try this out just download the python filed install dependecies and make a MLM with yolo then just google how to transform ur MLM to onnx and use engine.py or do it urself to transform the onnx to engine. After that just change the path in engineThreads2.py and start the file pt.py and such use the normal MLM so u can just ignore them (just look in the code which keybinds are for activation etc. and change them to ur liking)
